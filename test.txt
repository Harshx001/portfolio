Hello, I'm Harsh Suryawanshi, a passionate and dedicated Full Stack Developer.
I completed my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering, 
with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, from Samrat
 Ashok Technological Institute in 2025.

I recently completed an internship at Micro SaaS Capital as a Software Development Intern
, where I contributed to various projects involving API integration, backend logic, 
and collaborated closely with the product team to enhance user functionality.

With over 1 year of hands-on experience in building and maintaining scalable 
applications, Iâ€™ve worked extensively on API development, database design, a
nd end-to-end full-stack solutions.

I'm skilled in Java, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and have practical 
experience with tools and frameworks like React, Node.js, and MySQL. I take
 pride in writing clean, modular code and building systems that are both efficient and user-friendly.

I'm always eager to learn emerging technologies, contribute to impactful 
projects, and grow within a collaborative and innovative team environment.
